This file is mainly targeted to help the audience to setup my portfolio site for their view and this can be done in just 2 simple steps:
1)	Clone the repository which will have an img folder and an html file. 
2)	Open the .html file in Google Chrome

Hurray!!! You will now be able to see my portfolio.
